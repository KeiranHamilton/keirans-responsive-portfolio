        <p>
          My name is Keiran Hamilton and I am originally from Jacksonville, NC.
          I was a military brat so I have lived in quite a few places growing
          up. My adult years have been spent in Raleigh which I now gladly call
          my home.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a full stack web developer out of the UNC bootcamp. I am both
          driven and self motivated.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy coding and the limitless possibilities it presents. You can
          basically construct anything that your mind can conjure up. Im looking
          forward to starting my career in web development. It is a hobby of
          mine that I enjoy doing everyday. I love learning new technologies,
          languages and techniques.
